The Following instructions are for .tar distributed UNIX software 9.7 or later.
For pre 9.7 software, please see below at heading PRE 9.7

 1. Make sure 32-bit support is enabled if installing a 32-bit product.
    The checklib.sh can verify that the necessary libraries are available to install.

 2. Go into super user mode with the 'su' command.

 3. Create a directory '/home/sunbelt.install' and change to it.

 4. Untar the downloaded file with the following command:

	tar -xvf {path to tar file}/{download}.tar
	
 5. Change the permissions on the install script as follows:

	chmod +x suninst
	
 6. Run './suninst' and follow the on screen instructions.  The default
    directory is '/home/sunbelt/{product.version}/'. This allows for
    multiple versions of a product to be installed without having to change
    the install directory.

 7. For PL/B, add the following three lines your '.profile'.  These lines
    assume the software was installed in the default directory.  If not, then
    simply change the '{install path}' to the directory where the software was
    installed

	PLB_SYSTEM={install path};export PLB_SYSTEM
	PLB_PATH={install path};export PLB_PATH
	PATH=$PATH:{install path}

    For SUNDM, modify 'sundm.cfg' as necessary for your system.

    For Application Server modify 'plbserve.ini' as necessary for your system.

    For PLB Web Server modify 'plbwebsrv.ini' as necessary for your system.

 8. 'login' again to activate the '.profile' commands.

 9. Run the 'env' command and make sure the above environment variables are
    present.

10. For PLB, Run the 'env' command and note the 'TERM=???' entry.  Make sure
    there is a '???.def' file in "{install path}".

11. If '???.def' does not exist, you must create one by running 'makedef'.

12. Please read any file that ends in .RFM or .ME for other information that
    may apply to your particular system

===============================================================================

PRE 9.7

The Following instructions are for .tar distributed UNIX software 8.4 to 9.6.

 1. Go into super user mode with the 'su' command.

 2. Create a directory '/.invisible' and change to it.

 3. Untar the plbinnvv.tar or plbcnnvv.tar file with the following command:

	tar -xvf {path to tar file}/{download}.tar
	
    (where nn is the operating system type and vv is the runtime version)
    (if your version contains a '.gz' at the end, it is compressed
    using gzip and will need to be decompressed using gunzip )

 4. Change the permissions on the install script as follows:

	chmod +x suninst
	
 5. Run './suninst loaded' and follow the on screen instructions.

 6. For PL/B, add the following three lines your '.profile'.  These lines
    assume the software was installed in the default directory.  If not, then
    simply change the '/usr/plc' to the directory where the software was
    installed

	PLB_SYSTEM=/usr/plc;export PLB_SYSTEM
	PLB_PATH=/usr/plc;export PLB_PATH
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/plc

    For SUNDM, modify the 'sundm.cfg' file as necessary for your system.

 7. 'login' again to activate the '.profile' commands.

 8. Run the 'env' command and make sure the above environment variables are
    present

 9. Run the 'env' command and note the 'TERM=???' entry.  Make sure there is a
    '???.def' file in /usr/plc

10. If '???.def' does not exist, you must create one by running 'makedef'.

11. Please read any file that ends in .RFM or .ME for other information that
    may apply to your particular system

===============================================================================

The install procedure has a default directory for each product being installed.
You can override the default and specify any other directory in which to
install the software.  If the directory is not already in the PATH environment
variable, you must modify the PATH variable to include the directory.

Again, thank you for your interest and do not hesitate to call if we can be of
service. We can be reached at the email: support.scsi@sunbelt-plb.com
