This sample is a simple Google charting program named 'chart_samp.pls' that demonstrates 
three basic HTML web page parts which are used to show a Google 
chart in a PL/B HtmlControl object.

See the following link for information on Google charts:

	https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/quick_start

The 'chart_samp.pls' program can be compiled and executed by PL/B runtimes as follows:

	Plbwin and Plbclient:
	
	The 'Microsoft Edge WebView2' control is used to display the Web content 
	in the HTMLCONTROL. For more information on 'WebView2', you can look in the 
	'PL/B Language Reference' manual under the 'WebView2 Support' sections.
	
	Plb Web Server:
	
	There are two simple changes that are needed to run the 'chart_samp.pls' program:
	
	1) Edit the plbwebstartwv.html file. Comment out the 
	
	   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ... 
	   
	   line and add in the 
	   
	   <script type='text/javascript' src='https://www.google.com/jsapi'></script> 
	   
	   line. This will cause the charting libraries to be loaded upon program startup. 
	   See the example_plbwebstartwv.html file.
		
	2) The 'chart_samp' program requires the 'Bootstrap 5' framework to be loaded and used 
	   for enhanced appearances required for the Google charts. This can be done by 
	   either  the chart_samp program using the .plcw extension or adding the 
	   'PLBWEB_USE_WEBVIEW=ON' keyword to the plbwebsrv.ini file.
